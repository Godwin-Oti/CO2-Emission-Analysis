OBFCM systems are commonly used in vehicles to monitor fuel consumption and efficiency.\\n\\n2. **Data Source**: This term refers to the origin or the place from which the data is obtained. It could be a sensor, a database, a file, or any other means of collecting data.\\n\\n3. **ID**: ID stands for Identification. In a dataset, it typically represents a unique identifier for each record or entry. It helps to uniquely identify each data point in the dataset.\\n\\n4. **OBFCM Reporting Period**: This is the time period over which the data from the OBFCM device is reported or recorded. It could be daily, weekly, monthly, etc., depending on how the data is collected and processed.\\n\\n5. **Registration Year**: This refers to the year in which the vehicle was registered. It provides information about the age or vintage of the vehicle.\\n\\n6. **Total fuel consumed (lifetime) (l)**: This represents the total amount of fuel consumed by the vehicle over its lifetime, measured in liters.\\n\\n7. **Total distance travelled (lifetime) (km)**: This indicates the total distance covered by the vehicle over its lifetime, measured in kilometers.\\n\\n8. **Total distance travelled in charge depleting operation with engine off (lifetime) (km)**: It represents the total distance traveled by the vehicle while operating in a charge depleting mode with the engine turned off, over its lifetime, measured in kilometers.\\n\\n9. **Total distance travelled in charge depleting operation with engine running (lifetime) (km)**: This is similar to the previous term, but it represents the total distance traveled by the vehicle in charge depleting mode with the engine running.\\n\\n10. **Total distance travelled in driver-selectable charge increasing operation (lifetime) (km)**: This refers to the total distance covered by the vehicle while operating in a mode where the driver can increase the charge of the battery, over its lifetime, measured in kilometers.\\n\\n11. **Total fuel consumed in charge depleting operation (lifetime) (l)**: It indicates the total amount of fuel consumed by the vehicle while operating in charge depleting mode over its lifetime, measured in liters.\\n\\n12. **Total fuel consumed in driver-selectable charge increasing operation (lifetime) (l)**: Similar to the previous term, but it represents the fuel consumed while operating in a mode where the driver can increase the charge of the battery.\\n\\n13. **Total grid energy into the battery (lifetime) (kWh)**: This refers to the total amount of energy supplied from an external power grid to charge the vehicle\\'s battery over its lifetime, measured in kilowatt-hours.\\n\\n14. **Used in calculation**: This likely indicates whether the specific data field was used in any calculations or analyses.\\n\\nThese terms are typically found in datasets related to vehicle performance, fuel consumption, and energy usage, particularly in the context of electric and hybrid vehicles.\\n\\nThe purpose of the charge-depleting mode is to maximize the use of electric power stored in the battery, thereby reducing fuel consumption and emissions, especially during city driving or other low-speed, stop-and-go situations where electric propulsion is most efficient.\\n\\nIn a charge-depleting mode, the vehicle primarily operates using the energy stored in its battery pack. During this mode, the vehicle\\'s electric motor(s) are used to propel the vehicle, drawing power from the battery.
